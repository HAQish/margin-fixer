<p class="p1"><span class="s1">THE EPISTLE TO THE READER</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">READER,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have put into thy hands what has been the diversion of some of my idle</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and heavy hours. If it has the good luck to prove so of any of thine,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and thou hast but half so much pleasure in reading as I had in writing</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it, thou wilt as little think thy money, as I do my pains, ill bestowed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mistake not this for a commendation of my work; nor conclude, because I</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was pleased with the doing of it, that therefore I am fondly taken with</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it now it is done. He that hawks at larks and sparrows has no less</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sport, though a much less considerable quarry, than he that flies at</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">nobler game: and he is little acquainted with the subject of this</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">treatise--the UNDERSTANDING--who does not know that, as it is the most</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">elevated faculty of the soul, so it is employed with a greater and more</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">constant delight than any of the other. Its searches after truth are a</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sort of hawking and hunting, wherein the very pursuit makes a great</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">part of the pleasure. Every step the mind takes in its progress towards</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Knowledge makes some discovery, which is not only new, but the best too,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for the time at least.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the understanding, like the eye, judging of objects only by its own</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sight, cannot but be pleased with what it discovers, having less regret</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for what has escaped it, because it is unknown. Thus he who has raised</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">himself above the alms-basket, and, not content to live lazily on scraps</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of begged opinions, sets his own thoughts on work, to find and follow</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">truth, will (whatever he lights on) not miss the hunter's satisfaction;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">every moment of his pursuit will reward his pains with some delight; and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">he will have reason to think his time not ill spent, even when he cannot</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">much boast of any great acquisition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This, Reader, is the entertainment of those who let loose their own</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">thoughts, and follow them in writing; which thou oughtest not to envy</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">them, since they afford thee an opportunity of the like diversion, if</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">thou wilt make use of thy own thoughts in reading. It is to them, if</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they are thy own, that I refer myself: but if they are taken upon trust</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">from others, it is no great matter what they are; they are not following</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">truth, but some meaner consideration; and it is not worth while to be</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">concerned what he says or thinks, who says or thinks only as he is</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">directed by another. If thou judgest for thyself I know thou wilt judge</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">candidly, and then I shall not be harmed or offended, whatever be thy</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">censure. For though it be certain that there is nothing in this Treatise</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the truth whereof I am not fully persuaded, yet I consider myself as</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">liable to mistakes as I can think thee, and know that this book must</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stand or fall with thee, not by any opinion I have of it, but thy own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If thou findest little in it new or instructive to thee, thou art not to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">blame me for it. It was not meant for those that had already mastered</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">this subject, and made a thorough acquaintance with their own</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">understandings; but for my own information, and the satisfaction of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a few friends, who acknowledged themselves not to have sufficiently</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">considered it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Were it fit to trouble thee with the history of this Essay, I should</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tell thee, that five or six friends meeting at my chamber, and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">discoursing on a subject very remote from this, found themselves quickly</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">at a stand, by the difficulties that rose on every side. After we had</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">awhile puzzled ourselves, without coming any nearer a resolution of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">those doubts which perplexed us, it came into my thoughts that we took</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a wrong course; and that before we set ourselves upon inquiries of that</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">nature, it was necessary to examine our own abilities, and see what</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">OBJECTS our understandings were, or were not, fitted to deal with. This</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I proposed to the company, who all readily assented; and thereupon</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it was agreed that this should be our first inquiry. Some hasty and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">undigested thoughts, on a subject I had never before considered, which</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I set down against our next meeting, gave the first entrance into this</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Discourse; which having been thus begun by chance, was continued by</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">intreaty; written by incoherent parcels; and after long intervals of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">neglect, resumed again, as my humour or occasions permitted; and at</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">last, in a retirement where an attendance on my health gave me leisure,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it was brought into that order thou now seest it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This discontinued way of writing may have occasioned, besides others,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">two contrary faults, viz., that too little and too much may be said in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it. If thou findest anything wanting, I shall be glad that what I have</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">written gives thee any desire that I should have gone further. If it</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">seems too much to thee, thou must blame the subject; for when I put pen</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to paper, I thought all I should have to say on this matter would have</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">been contained in one sheet of paper; but the further I went the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">larger prospect I had; new discoveries led me still on, and so it grew</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">insensibly to the bulk it now appears in. I will not deny, but possibly</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it might be reduced to a narrower compass than it is, and that some</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">parts of it might be contracted, the way it has been writ in, by</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">catches, and many long intervals of interruption, being apt to cause</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">some repetitions. But to confess the truth, I am now too lazy, or too</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">busy, to make it shorter. I am not ignorant how little I herein consult</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">my own reputation, when I knowingly let it go with a fault, so apt to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">disgust the most judicious, who are always the nicest readers. But they</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">who know sloth is apt to content itself with any excuse, will pardon me</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">if mine has prevailed on me, where I think I have a very good one. I</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">will not therefore allege in my defence, that the same notion, having</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">different respects, may be convenient or necessary to prove or</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">illustrate several parts of the same discourse, and that so it has</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">happened in many parts of this: but waiving that, I shall frankly avow</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that I have sometimes dwelt long upon the same argument, and expressed</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it different ways, with a quite different design. I pretend not to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">publish this Essay for the information of men of large thoughts and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">quick apprehensions; to such masters of knowledge I profess myself a</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">scholar, and therefore warn them beforehand not to expect anything here,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but what, being spun out of my own coarse thoughts, is fitted to men of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">my own size, to whom, perhaps, it will not be unacceptable that I have</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">taken some pains to make plain and familiar to their thoughts some</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">truths which established prejudice, or the abstractedness of the ideas</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">themselves, might render difficult. Some objects had need be turned on</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">every side; and when the notion is new, as I confess some of these are</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to me; or out of the ordinary road, as I suspect they will appear to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">others, it is not one simple view of it that will gain it admittance</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">into every understanding, or fix it there with a clear and lasting</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">impression. There are few, I believe, who have not observed in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">themselves or others, that what in one way of proposing was very</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">obscure, another way of expressing it has made very clear and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">intelligible; though afterwards the mind found little difference in the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">phrases, and wondered why one failed to be understood more than the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">other. But everything does not hit alike upon every man's imagination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have our understandings no less different than our palates; and he</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that thinks the same truth shall be equally relished by every one in the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">same dress, may as well hope to feast every one with the same sort of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cookery: the meat may be the same, and the nourishment good, yet every</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">one not be able to receive it with that seasoning; and it must be</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">dressed another way, if you will have it go down with some, even of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">strong constitutions. The truth is, those who advised me to publish it,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">advised me, for this reason, to publish it as it is: and since I have</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">been brought to let it go abroad, I desire it should be understood by</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">whoever gives himself the pains to read it. I have so little affection</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to be in print, that if I were not flattered this Essay might be of some</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">use to others, as I think it has been to me, I should have confined</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it to the view of some friends, who gave the first occasion to it. My</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">appearing therefore in print being on purpose to be as useful as I may,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think it necessary to make what I have to say as easy and intelligible</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to all sorts of readers as I can. And I had much rather the speculative</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and quick-sighted should complain of my being in some parts tedious,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">than that any one, not accustomed to abstract speculations, or</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">prepossessed with different notions, should mistake or not comprehend my</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">meaning.}</span></p>
